# We_Rate_Dogs-Twitter-wrangling-Project
This project was prepared as a practice to lessons under the Data wrangling section on the ALX-T Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.  The focus of the project is to gather data from different sources and wrangle for the tweet archive of @dog_rates also known as WeRateDogs.
The data from different sources are then gathered and merged into one single dataset and three insights were drawn using visualizations.
